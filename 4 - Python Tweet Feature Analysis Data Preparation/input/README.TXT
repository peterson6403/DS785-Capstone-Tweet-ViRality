This is a manually-entered table that contains usernames of Twitter users whose tweets were to be analyzed for feature analysis.

The users were categorized by user type as determined through background domain knowledge and best judgement.

Most users were taken from the list of influential users identified by the network analysis while the others were found during a manual search in the Twitter user interface using some VR-related content browsing.
